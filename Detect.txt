Phishing Playbook: Detection Section
1. Real-Time Email Monitoring and Analysis
Automated Email Filtering

Implement advanced email filtering solutions that use machine learning and threat intelligence to detect and block phishing emails.
Regularly update the filtering rules and databases with the latest threat intelligence.
Content Analysis

Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze the content of incoming emails for signs of phishing, such as urgent language, suspicious links, and requests for sensitive information.
Implement heuristics to detect common phishing tactics, such as spoofed sender addresses and disguised URLs.
2. URL and Link Inspection
URL Reputation Services

Integrate with reputable URL reputation services to check the safety of links in emails in real-time.
Maintain a dynamic blacklist of known phishing URLs and domains, updating it frequently.
Sandboxing for Link Analysis

Use sandbox environments to safely open and analyze suspicious links and attachments.
Monitor the behavior of the sandboxed environment for any signs of malicious activity.
3. Attachment and Document Scanning
Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)

Deploy ATP solutions that can scan email attachments for malicious content.
Use both static and dynamic analysis techniques to identify potential threats.
Behavioral Analysis of Office Documents

Implement solutions that detect anomalous behaviors in office documents, such as unexpected macro executions or process spawning.
Specifically monitor for:
PowerShell commands
CMD execution
WMI scripts
MSHTA usage
Use machine learning models to differentiate between legitimate and malicious document activities.
4. User Reporting and Feedback Loop
Phishing Reporting Mechanism

Provide an easy-to-use reporting mechanism (e.g., a "Report Phish" button in email clients) for users to report suspected phishing emails.
Ensure that reported emails are automatically collected and analyzed by the security team.
Automated Feedback Loop

Implement automated responses to user reports, thanking them for their vigilance and informing them of any immediate actions taken.
Use the data from reported phishing attempts to continuously update and improve detection algorithms.
5. Threat Intelligence Integration
Integration with Threat Intelligence Feeds

Subscribe to multiple threat intelligence feeds to receive timely updates on emerging phishing threats and tactics.
Integrate these feeds into the email filtering and monitoring systems to enhance detection capabilities.
Collaboration with External Security Communities

Participate in security information-sharing communities and forums to stay informed about the latest phishing trends and indicators of compromise (IOCs).
Share anonymized phishing incident data with these communities to contribute to the collective defense against phishing.
6. Network and Endpoint Monitoring
Network Traffic Analysis

Monitor network traffic for signs of phishing activity, such as communication with known malicious IP addresses or domains.
Use intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and block suspicious network traffic.
Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)

Deploy EDR solutions on all endpoints to monitor for and respond to phishing-related activities.
Configure EDR solutions to alert on suspicious behaviors, such as unexpected process executions or changes to system files that may indicate a phishing attack.
7. Behavioral Analytics
User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)

Implement UEBA solutions to detect abnormal user behaviors that may indicate a compromised account due to phishing.
Analyze patterns such as unusual login times, access to sensitive data, and large data transfers.
Anomaly Detection

Use machine learning models to detect anomalies in email traffic and user behavior.
Continuously train these models on new data to improve their accuracy and effectiveness.
8. Continuous Improvement and Adaptation
Regular Phishing Simulations

Conduct regular phishing simulation exercises to test the effectiveness of detection mechanisms and user awareness.
Use the results of these exercises to refine detection strategies and user training programs.
Incident Post-Mortem Analysis

Perform detailed post-mortem analyses of phishing incidents to understand how they bypassed existing defenses.
Use these insights to update and enhance detection techniques and processes.
Metrics and Reporting

Track key metrics such as the number of phishing emails detected, the response time to reported phishing attempts, and the success rate of phishing simulations.
Regularly report these metrics to senior management and use them to drive continuous improvement in phishing detection capabilities.
