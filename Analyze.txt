Phishing Playbook: Verification Section
1. Initial Double-Check
In Conjunction with a Senior SOC Member
Review initial detection data and incident reports.
Rule out false positives by cross-referencing with legitimate activities.
2. Identifying and Validating IOCs (Indicators of Compromise)
Validate Hashes

Use VirusTotal and Hybrid Analysis to validate the hashes of suspicious files.
Check the reputation and past behaviors associated with the hashes.
Document findings and flag known malicious hashes.
Validate Links

Use VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, and URLScan to analyze suspicious URLs.
Verify the URL's reputation and check for any associated malicious activities.
Document the results of these validations.
Identify Email Attributes

Examine the emailâ€™s subject, attachments, and sender address.
Identify other potentially suspicious email addresses, domains, and IP addresses using:
VirusTotal
Hybrid Analysis
Talos Intelligence
Search Threat Intelligence Sources

Perform a thorough search on VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, and Talos Intelligence for the identified IOCs.
Gather additional context and details about the threat actors and campaigns.
3. Disk Forensics on Recipient's Endpoint
Endpoint Analysis
Conduct disk forensics on the recipient's endpoint to uncover any signs of compromise.
Look for malicious files, unusual processes, and unauthorized changes.
Document all findings and correlate them with identified IOCs.
4. Enterprise-Wide Scanning
Update Spam Filter

Adjust spam filter rules to block further phishing attempts with identified IOCs.
Update Security Infrastructure

Update firewall (FW), intrusion detection system (IDS), and other security appliance rules with the identified IOCs.
Search Mail Folders for IOCs

Conduct an enterprise-wide search of all email folders for the identified IOCs.
Isolate and review any emails that match these indicators.
Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)

Utilize EDR tools to search endpoints for IOCs.
Monitor for any signs of infection or suspicious activity related to the phishing campaign.
5. Scope Update
Update Lists of Affected Entities
Maintain and update lists of:
Affected recipient addresses
Compromised endpoints
Impacted network enclaves
Affected business units
6. Scope Validation
Ensure Comprehensive Identification
Confirm all affected machines, mailboxes, URLs, domains, IP addresses, ports, files, and hashes have been identified.
If new IOCs or traces of phishing are discovered, repeat the verification steps.
Document each validation step and ensure completeness before moving to containment and eradication.
